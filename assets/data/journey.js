We designed a plugin that generates up-to-date documentation, creates mind maps and visualizations for better understanding, and detects conceptual duplicates in code. Using a <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Figma</a> prototype, we demonstrated how the extension could make documentation clearer at a high level, reduce wasted developer hours, and make onboarding easier.
