It was everyone's first year coding so we solved very simple problems to get used to C++, loops, recursion, matrices, and basic greedy & dynamic programming problems. One problem that I distinctevely remember solving was <a href=\"https://www.infoarena.ro/job_detail/1581717\" target=\"_blank\">`Spirala`</a> (problem text <a href=\"https://www.infoarena.ro/problema/spirala\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), because it was one of the first problems which felt intuitive for me to solve. Participated in the Local Stage of the CS Olympiad in Cluj-Napoca - barely got any points (massive fail), I wrote the wrong name for the input file haha. Was selected for a more restricted learning group with 4 other students organized by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/learnhouse/\" target=\"_blank\">Learnhouse</a>, taught by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/petru-wellcode\" target=\"_blank\">Petru Trimbitas</a>.",
